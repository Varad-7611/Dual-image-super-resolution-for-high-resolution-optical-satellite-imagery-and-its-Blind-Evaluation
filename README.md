# 🛰️ Dual Image Super-Resolution with Blind Evaluation

This project focuses on enhancing the resolution of satellite imagery by using two low-resolution (LR) optical satellite images of the same region. By combining classical image fusion techniques and deep learning (SRCNN), we generate a high-resolution (HR) image and evaluate its quality using both traditional and perceptual (blind) metrics.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ Upload two LR satellite images of the same area
- 🧠 Automatic image registration and alignment
- 🔁 Image fusion to combine complementary details
- 🧬 Super-resolution using a trained SRCNN model
- 📊 Evaluation metrics: PSNR, SSIM, MSE, RMSE, and Deep VGG Perceptual Distance
- 🌐 Streamlit Web UI (can also be deployed on Android/Web using Flask API)
- 📷 Outputs a high-resolution image and comparison with ground truth (if available)
